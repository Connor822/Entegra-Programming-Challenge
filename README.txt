This is my submission to the Entegra Programming Challenge
It makes use of the open source Stanford Named Entity Recognizer (NER)

To run the code, stanford-ner.jar - which is located in the folder ner - must be added to Classpath

The program will first ask for the number of lines of input, and then the input can be entered.
